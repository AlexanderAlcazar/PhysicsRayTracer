## Project Overview

Physics Ray Tracer models the behavior of physics-based rays interacting with user-defined boundaries and visualizes the results in an interpretable way.

---

## Main Features

- **Boundary Handling:** Allows creation and manipulation of boundaries for ray simulations.
- **Ray Dynamics:** Simulates rays with physics-based rules for interactions such as reflection.
- **Simulation Runner:** Integrates all components into a single executable for simulation execution.

## File Structure

1. **Boundary.py** ([View File](https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/PhysicsRayTracer/blob/master/Boundary.py)):
   Handles boundary logic for ray interaction simulations.

2. **Ray.py** ([View File](https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/PhysicsRayTracer/blob/master/Ray.py)):
   Implements the core functionality and attributes of a physics-based ray.

3. **main.py** ([View File](https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/PhysicsRayTracer/blob/master/main.py)):
   Entry point allowing seamless integration of rays and boundaries for simulation runs.
