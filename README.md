# Physics Ray Tracer

Physics Ray Tracer is a Python-based project designed to simulate and visualize the behavior of rays interacting with boundaries. It serves as an educational tool or a foundation for physics-based ray tracing applications.

## Features
- **Boundary Handling** - Define and manage boundaries using `Boundary.py`.
- **Ray Definition** - Implement physics-based ray functionalities with `Ray.py`.
- **Main Execution Script** - Run simulations or visualizations with `main.py`.

## File Descriptions
1. **Boundary.py** ([View File](https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/PhysicsRayTracer/blob/master/Boundary.py))
   - Handles boundary logic for ray interaction simulations.

2. **Ray.py** ([View File](https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/PhysicsRayTracer/blob/master/Ray.py))
   - Implements the core logic for ray behavior and its attributes.

3. **main.py** ([View File](https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/PhysicsRayTracer/blob/master/main.py))
   - The application's entry point that integrates rays and boundaries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/PhysicsRayTracer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PhysicsRayTracer
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
